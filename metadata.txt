This is the metadata for Juarez et al. Macroevolution of ostracod eyes and body size along the ecogeographical gradient of ocean depth

taxon - species name
count - number of ommatidia in the eye; value is the max ommatidia count for the species found in the literature, or the ommatidia count of the largest female we found in collections.
		Values of 1 were reported as 0 in the literature.
diam - The diameter of the largest ommatidium in the eye, measured directly from images in the literature or from museum specimens. Values in microns. 
length - The largest distance from the anterior to the posterior end of an ostracod. Measured in cm. 
eyelength - The largest distance from one end of the eye to the other. Measured in microns. 
depth - The deepest living depth we found for each species (in meters) which was reported in the literature or through various other sources (see Methods).
pelagic - Values represent the pelagic zone which the depth variable represents; 0 - euphotic, 1 - dysphotic, 2 - aphotic.
