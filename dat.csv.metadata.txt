dat.csv metadata from Juarez et al. Macroevolution of ostracod eyes and body size along the ecogeographical gradient of ocean depth

Data collected from a literature search, from Anna Syme, from the Smithsonian institution database, or measured directly from specimens. Data represent maxima for each species, where applicable (see Methods).

taxon - Species name
count - Number of ommatidia in the eye; value is the max ommatidia count for the species found in the literature, or the ommatidia count of the largest female we found in collections. Values of 1 were reported as 0 in the literature.
diam - The diameter of the largest ommatidium in the eye (microns).
length - The largest distance from the anterior to the posterior end of an ostracod (cm).
eyelength - The largest distance between two points on the eye (microns).
depth - The deepest living depth recorded for each species (meters).
pelagic - Values represent the pelagic zone which the depth variable represents; 0 - euphotic, 1 - dysphotic, 2 - aphotic.
width - The largest distance from the ventral to dorsal surfaces of the carapace, measured in cm. 

Variables with (M) are same as above, but for Males and not Females in the species. 

Notes - Important details.
Reference - Literature citations for data.
